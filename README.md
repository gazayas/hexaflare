There are a lot of issues with this code, mainly because this is a prototype of something I think would be cool to actually deploy in the future with more features and better gameplay. There are a lot of global variables, I'm not using modern import/export statements with modules, and there are close to no tests, so instead of taking what's here and making it better, I'd prefer to just start from scratch on a modern framework while using this repository as a reference.

However, this was really fun project to work on, and it was so cool to have an idea and make it a reality, so I want to keep it up on GitHub so the code doesn't get completely lost.

If you're interested, check out the steps I went through to develop Hexaflare in [this article](https://dev.to/gazayas/hexaflare-exploring-data-structures-1ond).
